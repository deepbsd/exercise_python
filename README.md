Just some exercises from the exercism.io website for the Python language


Exercism.io is a terrific website that has "challenge tracks" for many popular (and some obscure) programming
languages.  Not only will you find tracks for Java, C and C++, but you'll also find tracks for Lua, Delphi, and
Clojure and Vim script.  There's even a track for Perl 6!  

At this point, the handful of languages that I work with--Python, Javascript, Ruby, Bash, and Perl--are plenty to
keep me busy.
